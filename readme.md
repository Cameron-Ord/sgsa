4-Voice Polyphonic Synth
A 4-voice polyphonic synthesizer using PortMidi for MIDI input and SDL3 for audio output.

> This project is not complete and is still in progress. It is not really at a stage that I want it to be yet.

## Features
- 4 simultaneous voices – full polyphony for complex chords and melodies.
- Oscilator layering.
- MIDI controller – play live with any MIDI keyboard.
- Cross-platform – built on SDL3 and PortMidi for broad compatibility.

## Dependencies
PortMidi
 – MIDI input handling.
SDL3
 – audio output.

## License
- MIT License – feel free to use or modify.

## Todo
- Make things more customizable - use less constants for some stuff.
- Add filter effects; like reverb, maybe.
- Since it uses SDL, possibly add an optional visualizer
- Implement internal samplerate changing to mess around with different sample rates for different sounds
